/// The turn is a baton. A program takes it when it starts and gives it up while it waits for a call, and an event takes it for as long as its handlers run; nobody runs without
/// it. What is not the baton is the rule for who may take it: a synchronous event may whenever it is free - which it is, because the program that made the call it was
/// raised by gave it up - and an asynchronous one only when the session is <see cref="IsOpenForEvents">open to them</see>, which is when no program runs or one pumps. Deciding
/// which an event is belongs to whatever received it, which knows whether a call was pending.
/// <para>
/// Who a thread runs code for is the turn's to know as well: the program, an event of the program, or code beside a program that waits at a stop. An event is the program's
/// when the thread that gave the turn up for it was the program's or an event of the program's, and the code's beside the stop when that code gave it up.
