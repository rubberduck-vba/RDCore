/// A list is asked for as a name is typed and again after a <c>.</c>, which is a trigger character. A <c>!</c> is not: the name after it is a dictionary

/// matches, its start or its humps (<see cref="SDK.Model.Symbols.Completion.CompletionCandidates.MatchOf"/>), the best item preselected, and it is incomplete:
/// a client asks again as the word grows. An item is whole as it is answered: there is nothing to resolve.

/// An argument whose parameter is an <c>Enum</c> is offered its constants first, the first of them preselected (<c>MsgBox "Hello", </c> offers
